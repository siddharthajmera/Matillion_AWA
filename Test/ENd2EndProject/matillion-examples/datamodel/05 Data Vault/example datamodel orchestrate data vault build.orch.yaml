        This is an example of an ODS-to-Data Vault 2.0 data transformation. It reads from a layer of views on top of the ODS data.

        Like 3NF, Data Vault represents the data in a system-independent, highly structured way.
        More discussion on Data Vault at [https://www.matillion.com/resources/developer-relations/declarative-data-vault-2-0-in-snowflake-with-matillion-etl](https://www.matillion.com/resources/developer-relations/declarative-data-vault-2-0-in-snowflake-with-matillion-etl)

        A Data Vault layer should contain ``all`` the data from ``all the relevant source systems.
